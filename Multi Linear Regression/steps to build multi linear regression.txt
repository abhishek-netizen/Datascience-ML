Steps to work on Multilinear regression:
----------------------------------------------------

step1:Plot the scatter plot,Visualize the data. also try to Visualize the data with the help of hist,qqplot,boxplot
      Try to find variance and standard deviations
      have a look at summary of the dataset
step2:Try to build The Linear Model of interest.
step3:check for colinearity between the independent variables
step4:Try to increase the model performamnce, by increasing R^2.
---------------------------------------------------------
Methods to increase R^2::
Method1:Inorder to increase R^2, Remove the variables which are not influencing my target(dependent)Variable.
Method2:Check for correlation between the Target variable and independent variable by using correlation matrix,
and remove varibles which are not helping to increase R^2. build Linear model again.

AltMethod1: We can also remove the variable by checking variation inflation factor
by using function VIF() in R. The feature which is having more VIF value should be eliminatred.
AltMethod2: One more method is also by using Akaike's information criterion(AIC), install package("MASS")
and envoke its library
and apply function StepAIC() "The model with less AIC" is the better model
AltMethod3:if we used our lot of money and time in collecting the required data which satisifies our purpose or 
we may have limited amount of data, in such cases..
Removing the complete feature which is not influencing our target variable, is not a good idia!,
so we decided to remove the rows (or the points) instead of removing the complete feature.
which can be done with the help of cooks distance, visualize the cooks distance by writing 
influence.measures(dataset)
influenceIndexplot(dataset)
influencePlot(dataset) #In cooks distance remove the datapoints which are greater than p=0.5

AltMethod4: one more method is that by using stepwise linear regression. to learn visit the link below.
